career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Started university education as an Energy Engineer with speciality on physical models, simulation 
      and numerical methods, I started my career working as a consultant in the building energy sector.
      As I started gaining experience in energy simulations and software development, soon I looked for more
      challenges and started working as a researcher in energy storage devices, developing simulation 
      software for Lithium Ion batteries. After some time, fate made me move to a different city and
      changed the focus of my work back to the building energy sector, but dedicated to software 
      development for automated control of building systems.
      Through my carrer I've had to deal with code in many languages (C/C++, Java, Ruby, R, Matlab, Fortran, 
      Modelica, Perl ...) but my main programing language which I'm proefficient in is Python.
